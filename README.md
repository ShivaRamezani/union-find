# union-find

First put the number of elements (names) you want to add at the top.

Then put the elements afterwards. Each one in a new line since it is reading entire lines for a single position in the array.

There is an example data set included to see how things should be input. (data.txt)

Doing the union, find, and delete are explained in the program.
